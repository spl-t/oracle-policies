# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Oracle ("the Bot") handles information when you use our Discord bot.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not store personal information
- We do not store message content
- We do not store user IDs permanently
- We do not track user activity across servers

### Information Temporarily Processed
When you use a command, the Bot temporarily processes:
- Your Discord username (for display in embed footers)
- Your Discord avatar URL (for display in embed footers)
- The command you executed

This information is used only to generate the response and is not stored after the command completes.

## 2. How We Use Information

The temporarily processed information is used solely to:
- Display your username/avatar in command responses
- Provide the requested information
- Apply command cooldowns (stored in memory only, not persisted)

## 3. Data Storage

- The Bot does not maintain a database of user information
- No personal data is written to disk or stored persistently
- Command cooldowns are stored in memory and cleared when the Bot restarts

## 4. Third Parties

- We do not share, sell, or transfer any user information to third parties
- The Bot operates through Discord's API and is subject to Discord's Privacy Policy

## 5. Data Security

While we do not store personal data, we take reasonable measures to ensure the Bot operates securely and does not expose any information processed during command execution.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Bot is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The Bot follows Discord's age requirements.

## 7. Your Rights

Since we do not store personal data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete. If you have concerns, you can:
- Stop using the Bot at any time
- Remove the Bot from your server
- Contact us with questions

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date.

## 9. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Bot's feedback command or GitHub repository.
